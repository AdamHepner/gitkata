With Programming katas you delete your code after the kata. \r\n\r\nYou can, and I did use this for learning new languages, honing your IDE skills or explore various ways of solving a given problem.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of variations of this idea. There are [Code Katas](http://codekata.pragprog.com/), there are [Architectural Katas](http://www.architecturalkatas.com/) and now here are Git Katas (or soon to come).\r\n\r\n## What is a Git Kata?\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple: setup a problem as you might experience during Git usage, solve it using git. Repeat. This site does most of the setup part for you, so you can concentrate on solving the problem.","name":"Gitkata"}
